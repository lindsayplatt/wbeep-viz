# Water Budget Estimation and Evaluation Project (WBEEP) Visualization
This project produces an interactive, national scale, choropleth map using Hydrologic Resource Units (HRUs) as 
data groupings. A HRU is the smallest spatial unit of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) 
which is widely used to relate farm management practices to effects on surface waters at the
watershed scale. The HRU is not generally defined by physically meaningful boundaries but instead
lumps similar land uses, soils, and slopes within a sub-basin based upon user-defined thresholds. 

This project plots the boundaries of HRUs and colors the interior of each HRU based on calculated 
water data availability values using JavaScript, the Vue framework, and Mapbox-gl to produce a
'zoomable' national level map.

## Project setup
Clone the project. Then run 'npm install' to pull down the required dependencies into the node modules folder 
```
npm install
```

Starting the Vue development server at this point will show a website with headers and footers but no map.

```
npm run serve
```
#### Get the tiles from S3 to consolidate and simplify working with the map locally. If you pulled recent code, you are only a few simple steps from having a working map.
Now you can run the map locally from S3 without the need for local tile servers, however it still may be of benefit to read the sections after this one that explain how to set up 
the tiles to run from a local source.

But for now, here is the easy way.

There is a file in the project called mapStyles.js (src/mapStyles/mapStyles.js). This is a configuration file for Mapbox and it tells Mapbox a bunch
of important details about how to create the map. What is important to us at the moment are two things, the 'source' and the 
'source-layer.' The 'source' is where Mapbox should look for the 'tiles.' The 'source-layer' is only important to vector
tile sources, so for something like pure GeoJson you will not need it, but since our tiles are vector we will need to make
sure our source layer is correct.

The mapStyles.js is really just a ES6 JSON object called 'style', so like all JSON objects it is made up of key/value pairs.
Of main concern is the 'sources' key. In the following example, we can see that there are two sources for our map layers.
one called 'basemap' and another called 'HRU.' Mapbox needs two bits of information to process the source correctly, the 
'type' and the location. Mapbox can process many different source types, the source we are using are vector, meaning mathematical
created lines rather than dot graphed. Our vector tiles are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and we have to tell that to 
Mapbox. What is important here is to know that our 'tiles' on AWS are in 'protobuf' format (.pbf). Protobuf is one of several
tile formats that Mapbox can use. To load a '.pbf' source, we need the "tiles" key along with the resource location
in the form of an array as shown below (for more information read the 'Wait! Important to know: Local tiles and AWS 
tiles are DIFFERENT!' section). 
```
    style: {
        version: 8,
        sources: {
            basemap: {
                type: "vector",
                "tiles": ["https://d38anyyapxci3p.cloudfront.net/baseTiles_3/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf"]             
            },
            HRU: {
                type: "vector",
                "tiles": ["https://d38anyyapxci3p.cloudfront.net/tileTemp_3/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf"]               
            }
        },
```
If you pulled the code from Github, there will be a tiny bit of the work you need to do to get the map running locally.

Looking at the following snippet from the mapStyles.js, you will see a large amount of comments. Of interest is the '// BASE SOURCE INSERT'.
When the application is built for deployment to S3, using the job runner called Jenkins, a script will search fot
this comment line and replace it with the correct tile URL needed when the application is run on S3.

```
export default {
    style: {
        version: 8,
        sources: {
            basemap: {
                type: 'vector',
                // The following line is used as a reference point for automated builds
                // to insert the correct base tile location - do not modify:
                // BASE SOURCE INSERT

                // If you are setting up a local build, you can uncomment the following
                // URL assignment to pull the base tiles from S3 so that no local tile
                // server is required:
                //'tiles': ['https://d38anyyapxci3p.cloudfront.net/basetiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf']
                //
                // The following URL is an example of using a local mbtiles file and a
                // tile server.  See the readme for more information:
                // https://github.com/usgs-makerspace/wbeep-viz#start-run-the-tile-server
                // url: 'http://localhost:8086/data/basemap.json'

            },
```
Locally, the build scripts used to deploy the application to S3 will not be run, so we will need tell MapBox where to find
the map tiles we want it use. As noted in the comments above, we can use 'tiles': ['https://d38anyyapxci3p.cloudfront.net/basetiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf']' as
the tile source. This URL is for the 'beta' S3 bucket in our deployment tiers. For reference the other buckets are 'test',
'qa', and 'prod'. At various times you may wish to use tiles from any of these buckets as a source.

Once you un-comment the line mentioned above, MapBox will pull the tiles from S3 and the map will run. Note, you will have to
un-comment every source used. At the time of writing, there are two sources used, 'basemap' and 'HRU'.

So what if you map is still not working? It may be that 
1) the tiles are located in a different location on S3
2) you do not have the right 'source-layer' name

So, about sources and layers. Each source can be the parent of many map layers. Remember, that in the sample above, we had
two sources. That does not mean that we have only two layers. Each source can hold the information needed to make many layers.
In our map, we do just that. And we let Mapbox know which layers to make from each source by adding that information into the
Mapbox configuration file, which, as mentioned previously, is called mapStyles.js in our project.
```
            {
                id: "HRUS Fill Colors",
                type: "fill",
                source: "HRU",
                "source-layer": "no_simp_prec5", // make sure this name is right
                "layout": {
                    "visibility": "visible"
                },
                paint: {
                    "fill-color": {
                        "property": "SoilMoisture",
                        "type": 'categorical',
                        "stops": [
                            ["","#000000"],
                            ["very low","#CC4C02"],
                            ["low", "#EDAA5F"],
                            ["average","#FED98E"],
                            ["high","#A7B9D7"],
                            ["very high","#144873"],
                        ]
                    },
                    "fill-opacity": 1
                },
                "showButton": true
            },
``` 
Above, is a sample of that shows how a map layer is defined. The detail that is important here is to note the 'source-layer'
key. This has to match the name of the 'source-layer' in the tiles, and the name is defined by the person creating the tiles.
So, it sometimes changes. If you find that a layer is not showing as expected, check that the 'source-layer' has the correct name.

How do you know the name of the 'source-layer?' Well, it is not totally straight-forward. A way that works is to us a handy
program called, Vector Inspector https://stevage.github.io/vector-inspector/ . 'Vector Inspector' will give the name of
the 'source-layer' as shown circled in the image below. 
![alt text](./markDownImages/VectorInspector.png "Image of Vector Inspector")
 
Okay the above information should get your map working. However, if for some reason you chose to go 'old school' and run the tiles from a local source, there are a few things you need to know. 
1) Get the map tiles and add them to the project
2) Check that URLs for the tiles are correct
3) Start run the tile server

#### Wait! Important to know: Local tiles and AWS tiles are DIFFERENT!
Before we go on, I need to explain something. The environment on your local machine is different from that
on AWS. There are two important differences: 

First, on AWS, the built application (the contents of the 'dist' folder) is 
stored in a Simple Storage Service (S3) 'bucket.' We have told AWS to 'serve' the contents of that bucket so that
they may be used as a website. This is possible because AWS uses a simple web server to deliver the content of the 
bucket to a web browser. On your local machine, the Vue framework provides a development server that 
delivers the content to a browser.
 
Second, since AWS is a web resource, all the content on AWS has a URL.

These two things combine to influence the way our application runs in each environment. First, as we discuss in a moment,
Mapbox-gl requires map tiles to be identified by as a web resource. That means it needs the tiles to have a URL in order to 
use them. This is fine on AWS, as all the resources have URLs, however locally this will require us to use a 
tile server to generate a URL from which Mapbox-gl can fetch the tiles. Secondly, while all the resources on
AWS have URLs, AWS provides only a simple HTTP server to get those assets. Locally, our tile server(s) will do just a
bit more. The local tile server will take a single '.mbtiles' tile file, break it apart, and serve each part as an individual tile.

Now, we could have added a tile server to our application when deployed on AWS, but we wanted to keep our application
deployment simple (and inexpensive). Application deployments in AWS can use a S3 bucket as a source, only if they are static.
And by 'static' I mean they are applications that run on a users browser with the browser doing all the processing, and there
is no need for server-side-processing. Adding a tile server would mean we had added server-side-processing and we would no 
longer be able to use S3 as our host; we would have needed to switch to a more complex and expensive Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
instance. 

To avoid jumping up in cost and complexity to EC2, we compensated for the AWS HTTP server's inability to clip up '.mbtiles' files
by doing that part ourselves. So, on AWS we store the map tiles not as a single '.mbtiles' file but as a folder of folders,
with each folder containing sets of '.pbf' files that represent map 'zoom' level. Since we have manually done the tile cutting,
the simple HTTP server on AWS can do the rest.

Why is this important:
- on AWS, the the map tiles are 'cut' into '.pbf' files.
- on your local machine, you will have a single '.mbtiles' file (you may have several of these, but the each represent a single map layer)
- on AWS, the simple HTTP server will deliver the tile files
- on your local machine, you will need to start a tile server for each '.mbtiles' file

### Get the map tiles and add them to the project
One way to get the tiles is take them from storage on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The most current copy should be stored
at this AWS location:
```
prod-owi-resources/resources/Application/wbeep/tiles_current
```
Unfortunately there is no way to download the contents of an entire directory from S3 using the graphic
user interface, arrgh. So to get the tile files you will have to install AWS-CLI. This is accomplished by
using 'pip.' 

```
// this is an example, it is highly recommend that you do an internet search
// for the most recent install information
sudo pip install awscli
```
Installing AWS-CLI is the easy part, now you have to configure the credentials. First, you have to get the
credentials. For obvious reasons, I can not give too much detail here, and you will have to contact a team 
member for more specific advice. However, once you have the credentials you will run . . .
```
aws configure
```
This will start a program that will ask you to enter four items:
1) AWS Access Key ID 
2) AWS Secret Access Key 
3) Default region name
4) Default output format

The answers you enter will be saved at ~/.aws/credentials on Linux, macOS, or Unix, or at C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials on Windows.
I am not sure if it best practice, but I have edited this file manually without problems. 

If you open the '.aws' directory you will find two text files: 'credentials,' and 'config.' The 'config' contains the answers to the
last two questions and the name of the profile.
```
// example of 'config'

[default] // this is the profile
region = '' // this is the location of the AWS server like 'us-west-2'
output = json // this seems fine
``` 
When opened in a text editor, the credentials file looks something like this:
```
[default] // again, this is the profile
aws_access_key_id = the key id you added
aws_secret_access_key = the key you added
```
Once that is all set up, you are good to go. The AWS-CLI will find the credentials, and you will not be prompted
to enter them when you run commands such as . . .
```
// General example to copy directory from S3 to current working directory
aws s3 cp s3://mybucket . --recursive

// Specific Example for grabbing '.mbtiles' and placing them in the current working directory
// We have been using the 'tiles' directory at the project root
aws s3 cp s3://prod-owi-resources/resources/Application/wbeep/tiles_current . --recursive 
```

#### Manual Upload of Tiles
If you ever need to manually upload tiles to AWS, this command works provided you have installed AWS-CLI
on your machine and that you have configured the credentials. 
```
// generic example
aws s3 cp <local directory> <s3 target bucket> --recursive --content-encoding 'gzip' --content-type 'application/gzip'

// Note: using the 'content-type' application/x-protobuf also seems to work, and may be the better choice
// Here a specific example
aws s3 cp . s3://wbeep-qa-website/tiles --recursive --content-encoding 'gzip' --content-type 'application/x-protobuf'
```
If you do not configure the file compression correctly, when the application is run, Mapbox-gl will not be able to read the tiles, leaving you with
a map-less web page and a cryptic error in the console.
```
Unimplemented type: 3
```
This means that everything is working except that the compression type is not what Mapbox can use. 
The tiles will have to be reloaded to AWS with the correct content-type and content-encoding.

A note on content type: Using '--content-type 'application/gzip' such as in this example,
aws s3 cp . s3://wbeep-qa-website/tiles --recursive --content-encoding 'gzip' --content-type
 'application/gzip', will work in some browsers. We found that Chrome has no problem using this
 encoding. However, it will cause the 'Unimplemented type: 3' error, as mentioned above, when 
 using Firefox.


 
A second option, which avoids the hassle of configuring the AWS-CLI credential is to use the AWS UI to upload the files. 
Here you can drag and drop the files for uploading, just make sure to set both the 'content-encoding' and the 'content-type.'
The content-encoding will be 'gzip', and the content-type will be application/x-protobuf Note that there is not
a specific item in the drop down menu for these choices, but they can be added in the text box.

### Check that URLs for the tiles are correct
Locally, the tiles for the map will be served by 'tile servers.' These servers will need to know where the
tiles are stored on your machine and will produce a URL that Mapbox-gl can call. When Mapbox-gl calls,
the tile server will serve up the appropriate tiles. 

Please note that Mapbox-gl requires the map tiles to have a full URL, for example 'http://localhost:8086/data/basemap.json.'
or 'wbeep-test-website.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.' This is works fine for web based resources but makes using a relative path impossible, which means
that Mapbox-gl will require you to have a different URL for every deployment option. The path Mapbox-gl
uses are found in the style variable of the component creating the map element, such as 'MapBox.vue.'

```
    let style = {
        version: 8,
        sources: {
            basemap: {
                type: "vector",
                url: "http://localhost:8086/data/basemap.json" // here is one URL
            },
            HRU: {
                type: "vector",
                url: "http://localhost:8085/data/new2.json", // here is another

```
In the above example there are two URLs, one for the base map and a second one for the HRUs. Notice that
these are both local URLs. These URLs may differ slightly from what is required on your local machine. The main 
change would be the file names, which in the example are 'basemap.json' and 'new2.json.' These file names
need to match the names of the tile files (except the ending will be '.json' and not '.mbtiles'), which we will talk about later.

Now, since there are two URLs, we will need two tile servers, one to produce each URL. A perfectly good choice for
a tile server is tileserver-gl-light: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tileserver-gl-light . It is available as a npm
package. Follow the instructions on the tilesserver-gl-light page and install the tile server globally (use the -g flag).

### Start run the tile server
Now that you have a tile server installed locally, you can get the map up and running in the application.
The tileserver will need two items of information, the location of the tiles, and the port address on which 
to run.

```
tileserver-gl-light basemap.mbtiles -p 8086
```
The above example works when starting the tile server from directory containing the tile file to be used. In this case, the tile file
is named 'basemap.mbtiles. That is just an example name. The exact name may be different.
 
Using port 8086 is an arbitrary choice, but since the Vue development server is usually running on port 8080 this keeps conflicts to a 
minimum.  Also, the port number must match the port listed in the URL of the 'style' variable, as 
shown in the code snippet a few sections above and directly below.
```
url: "http://localhost:8086/data/basemap.json" 
// the server for the base maps must use port 8086 or at least match what is in the URL
```

Once you have the base map tile server running, it is time to start the server for the HRU layer. This 
is done in the same was as above, just change the name of the file and the port. In the following 
example, you would run the code from the directory containing the tile file.

```
// start the second tile server
// remember the file name will most likely be different
tileserver-gl-light new2.mbtiles -p 8085
``` 
Just as side note, notice that the file name in the above command matches the name of the tile file not 
the name in the in the style variable URL. The reference in the URL is to the file created by the tile server.

### Sit back and enjoy
One you have the tile servers and the Vue Development server running you are ready to check out the
application complete with map. Enjoy!


## Automated Builds

The project includes Docker and Jenkins files as well as a configuration shell script to support 
automated building of the Vue app via Jenkins (tiles are built in a separate process).  
Note that the hard-coded tile URLs in src/mapStyles/mapStyles.js are commented out
to facilitate this process.  You can uncomment them if you are doing a local build, but they
should remain commented out in the repository.  

Do not modify the comment lines containing BASE SOURCE INSERT or HRU SOURCE INSERT. 
The configuration script uses these as a reference point to insert the correct tile URLs for 
a given build.

The build process will remove all existing files from the targeted S3 bucket except for
the basetiles and tiles directories and their contents.

A variety of build scenarios are supported via build parameters in Jenkins:
- if no build destination is selected and no tile source is specified, then the application will be deployed to test and source its tiles from test
- if a build destination is selected but no tile source is specified, then the application will be deployed to the selected destination with tiles sourced from prod for all builds except test, which will source the tiles from test
- if a tile source is specified it will override the above behavior, so for example you could build to test using production tiles

## Add Font Awesome Icons
<a id="add_icons"></a>
So you want some cool icons, but do not have time to make them yourself. This is where Font Awesome comes in. Font Awesome
as a bunch of no free icons and also provides a Vue plugin to use them as mini Vue components.

To start we need to add three NPM packages to the project.

```
npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core 
npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons 
npm install --save @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome
``` 

Once these are installed, remember to stop and restart your Vue development server, if you had it running, so that it can pick up the changes.
 
Now turn your attention to 'main.js'. This is where we need to do our 'global' imports of NPM modules. If you did the 'makerspace-website-base'
tutorial, you will recall that this is where we imported the United States Web Design System (USWDS). We can do our imports
in any Vue component, but when we do the importing in 'main.js', we will have access to those imports in any Vue component in the 
project. Imports in other Vue components are only accessible from the component in which they were imported.

In 'main.js' we will first import the 'fontawesome' library. This will give us the 'library' object and allows us to 'add'
icons to it.
```
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
```

Next we will import the icon we want to use. Again we could do this in a specific Vue component, but doing it here will
let us use the icon anywhere in the project. 
```
import { faLayerGroup } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
```
The icon we are using is called 'layer-group', which is the image of a set of stacked layers, and I found it by browsing the Font Awesome Gallery (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).
Now you may have noticed that I said the icon is called 'layer-group', but we are importing 'faLayerGroup'. You may also be asking yourself,
'what is up with that?' And if you are, that is a reasonable question. Honestly, I do not know the answer, but I can tell 
you how to find the information you need to make the icon names work in Vue.

Step one - find the icon you want to use in the gallery mentioned previously. Somewhere near the icon you want to use it will say something like . . .
```
<i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i>
```
In old fashioned HTML markup this is code is what we would use, but this is not the syntax we want to use to include the icon in Vue. However, we do want to make note of the name. In this case,
'fa-layer-group'. Notice how similar that is to both our import of 'faLayerGroup' and our icon name of 
'layer-group'. Most of the time it is probably possible to guess the information we need from the 'class' information, 
however we can dig deeper to be sure.

Step two - find the icon in the 'node_modules' folder

So when we did our NPM installs, that process added a folder called '@fortawesome' (yes,'fort' not 'font') to
the 'node-modules' folder. Inside this folder, there are (at least) three more folders, one for each of the 
NPM installs we did earlier. In the 'free-solid-svg-icons' folder we will find a bunch of TypeScript and JavaScript
files. These files have names like 'faAddressBook.js' and 'faAddressBook.ts'. At this point, you may have caught on to the fact that
these files have the same name (minus the file extension) as the one in our import statement 'import { faLayerGroup } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons''

If you do not remember, here it is again . . .
```
import { faLayerGroup } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
```
You can safely click on one of the '.js' files such as 'faLayerGroup.js'. When this file opens, you will see that it has
information about the layer-group icon. Specifically (among other things), it says 'var iconName = 'layer-group';'. So we now know, definitively, the name
of our icon, which we will use when we place the icon on the page. This also confirms that we have imported our
icon from the correct '@fortawesome' subfolder, in this case 'free-solid-svg-icons'.

Alright, cool. We finally have this import stuff straightened away and can now move on to getting our little icon to work.

Step one - activate the special powers of the 'vue-fontawesome' module we installed and then imported in previous steps.
This module allows us to use the Font Awesome icons as 'mini' Vue components. To get this to work, we must
first 'register' it as a Vue component and give it a name like so . . .
```
Vue.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)
```
This calls the Vue method to register the 'FontAwesomeIcon' model we imported and names it 'font-awesome-icon'. 
You can name it anything you like, but for consistency it is probably best to stick with 'font-awesome-icon'. This is 
name you will use later when the icon is added to our Vue template(s) as a Vue component--which in old 
HTML would have been called an 'element'.

Step two - add the icon to the 'library' object. Since we globally imported the FontAwesome 'library' object, we can now use it throughout the application.
We can add our icon to the 'library' object with this code.
```aidl
library.add(faLayerGroup)
```
Sweet! Our importing and registering work in 'main.js' is done for now. If we want to add other Font Awesome icons
to our project later we just need to 1) import the specific icon from the 'node_modules' folder, and 2) add it to the 
'library' object. 

Now your 'main.js' should look something like . . .
```aidl
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import uswds from 'uswds'

import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { faLayerGroup } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome'

Vue.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)

library.add(faLayerGroup)

Vue.config.productionTip = false
Vue.use(uswds)

new Vue({
  render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app')
``` 

That was the hard part. Now we can go about merrily stuffing our new icon anywhere we like in our Vue project.
The process is this: 1) Go to the component where you would like to add the icon 2) In the 'template' element of that 
component add the icon as 'mini' Vue component like so . . .
```
<font-awesome-icon icon="layer-group" />
```
This is where the names we mentioned earlier come in to play. First, since we have registered 'font-awesome-icon' as
an Vue component, we can use it as HTML tag to create a Document Object Model (DOM) element. To this element, called
'font-awesome-icon', we will add the attribute 'layer-group', which as was also mentioned earlier is the name
of our icon. This tells Vue to stuff our 'layers-group' icon into the 'font-awesome-icon' element and display it on the web page.
If we were to add other Font Awesome icons, we could add them to the page using the same 'font-awesome-icon'
tag. The only change (assuming that you registered the new icons in 'main.js' (and I am sure you did)) is to change the name
of the 'icon' attribute to that of the new icon. For example . . .
```
<font-awesome-icon icon="layer-group" /> <!-- this adds the 'layer-group' icon -->
<font-awesome-icon icon="coffee" /> <!-- this adds the 'coffee' icon (if you registered it in 'main.js)' -->
```
Pretty straightforward, right? Well . . . now that you know the pattern it is.

#### Using Facebook and Twitter icons with Vue
Update - Okay here is another odd twist. In the above discussion, we talked about adding FontAwesome icons from the 
'free-solid-svg-icons' collection, and we basically worked out all the kinks in that process. However, there are other icons
out in the wilds of FontAwesome land that are 'free' to use, but are not in the 'free-solid-svg-icons' package that we 
previously imported. A good example of these are the ones typically used for links to Facebook and Twitter. If you look in 
the 'free-solid-svg-icons' package, you won't find them, because they are in a different package called 'free-brands-svg-icons'
that needs to be imported with NPM in a separate process.
```
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
```
Once you have the package imported you can use the icons with the same steps as mentioned above, as far as going to 'main.js'
and importing the individual icons and adding them to fontAwesome 'library' object. For example . . .

```
// Font Awesome-related initialization
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'
import { faFacebook, faTwitter } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons' // this are your new icons
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome'

// Add the specific imported icons
library.add(faFacebook) // add them individually to the library object
library.add(faTwitter)

// Enable the FontAwesomeIcon component globally
Vue.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)
```
BUT! At this point things get weird. Previously, we would have gone to one of our components and added the icon in a pattern
something like this:
```
<template>
  <div class="icons">
    <font-awesome-icon icon="twitter"/> // BUT!! Don't 'cause this will fail
    <font-awesome-icon icon="facebook"/> // Same here, total FAIL
  </div>
</template>
```
So if we attempt to add the icons way we did in the earlier section they will not work and you will get and error like .  . .
```
[Error] Could not find one or more icon(s) (2)
{prefix: "fas", iconName: "twitter"}
{}
```
Okay, this is annoying, but as you may have surmised, it is caused by the icons coming from a different FontAwesome package
than in the previous example. The error notes that it seeking an icon with the prefix 'fas'. The prefix 'fas' stands for 
'Font Awesome Solid' which kinda makes sense for icons in the 'free-solid-svg-icons' package but not so much for those in 
'free-brands-svg-icons'. But why is it looking for the prefix 'fas'? We never told it to do that! Well, apparently
this is related to behind-the-scenes coding of the 'FontAwesomeIcon' component which, you may remember, we wired our imported
icon to in the last step of our work in 'main,js'.
```// Enable the FontAwesomeIcon component globally
Vue.component('font-awesome-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)
```
Inside the code of the FontAwesomeIcon component there is a section that basically defaults to the most common prefix, of 'fas', unless 
you specifically tell it to do otherwise. To keep things brief, here is the magic way to tell the FontAwesomeIcon component 
to use 'fab' rather than 'fas' ('fab' for Font Awesome Brands verses 'fas' for Font Awesome Solid). Note, you only need add the
extra bit of JSON to icons outside of the 'fas' package, since the component creation code will default to 'fas' as the
icon prefix.
```
<template>
  <div class="icons">
    <font-awesome-icon :icon="{ prefix: 'fab', iconName: 'twitter' }"/>
    <font-awesome-icon :icon="{ prefix: 'fab', iconName: 'facebook' }"/>
  </div>
</template>
```

#### FontAwesome Icon (secret) Styling
Here is another interesting thing to know about using FontAwesome Icons as Vue components. When we wire up our icon as a 
Vue component, some more magic goes on in the background that adds style classes to the component. If you examine one of icons
with a browser's development tools you will see the element looks something like . . . 
```
<svg data-v-75bed3d5="" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="twitter-square" role="img"
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512" class="svg-inline--fa fa-twitter-square fa-w-14">
<path data-v-75bed3d5="" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>
```
In the above snippet, notice that there is a 'class' attribute with three assigned classes: 1) svg-inline--fa 2) fa-twitter-square, and 3) fa-w-14. These classes are added to the component during creation and we can target any of
them with CSS styling code. These classes are basically 'secret' and don't show in the code; they are only visible with 
the developer tools in the browser. So it is important to know that they are there (in hiding) as other developers may 
have targeted these classes, leaving you to wonder what the heck is going on.
