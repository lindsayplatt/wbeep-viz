          The {{ title }}  map shows the latest available daily estimates of natural
          water storage for approximately 110,000 regions across the lower forty-eight states.  Natural water storage shown
          includes water present on the landscape such as standing water and water on trees, snowpack, soil water, and
          shallow groundwater. It does not include water in rivers or deep groundwater. Map shading indicates the current
          natural water storage relative to historical conditions for this time of year.

          The latest model run requires a summary of the weather (precipitation and temperature) for a complete day.
          A sequence of operations begins at midnight starting with collecting observed weather data and ending several
          hours later with estimates of natural water storage and an updated map. For this reason, depending on the time
          of day relative to the latest update, the date at the top of the map will be yesterday or the day before
          yesterday. If the date is more than two days ago, that is an indication that some part of the update
          operations did not run successfully and the team is working to bring the system back online.

          It's a modeling unit or region called a National Hydrologic Model (NHM) Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU).
          Each watershed is broken up into these regions in order to assess the daily natural water storage.
          The boundaries are based on the area that flows to the left or right side of a river between an upstream
          and downstream location.
